# Blog-App

• Name of the program: Program to perform CRUD operation using 
                       databases.
• Operation: By using Flask, SQLAlchemy(Database) and JSON I 
have created a Blogging app, which performs create, read, update, 
delete (CRUD) operations. I have used HTML forms and the 
contents that has been filled in the form is inserted to database 
using POST method. We can retrieve the contents from the 
database using GET method. The jsonify() method displays the 
content in JSON format. When the requested url is not found in 
the server, 404 error message will be displayed in JSON format.
